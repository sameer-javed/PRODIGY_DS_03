# ðŸŒŸ Third Internship Milestone: Decision Tree Algorithm Development ðŸŒŸ

âœ¨ Iâ€™m excited to share my third milestone during my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**! âœ¨

In this task, I successfully developed a **Decision Tree Algorithm** to predict whether a customer would purchase a product or service based on their **demographic** and **behavioral data**. This project has provided me with deeper insights into the practical applications of **machine learning**, and it's been incredibly rewarding to work through the data and refine the model for better accuracy! ðŸ’¡ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview

This project involved several key steps, each contributing to the successful development and implementation of the Decision Tree model.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
   - Standardized the data formats to ensure consistency for analysis.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identified and selected key features that significantly impact customer purchase behavior.
   - Utilized techniques to determine feature importance to enhance model performance.

3. **Building and Fine-Tuning Decision Trees**:
   - Developed the Decision Tree model using **Scikit-learn**.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model for better prediction accuracy.

4. **Model Performance Analysis**:
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Visualized the decision tree to understand its structure and the logic behind predictions.

## Key Learnings:
- Gained experience in **data preprocessing** and **feature selection** techniques.
- Learned how to build and fine-tune **Decision Tree models** effectively.
- Enhanced my skills in **analyzing model performance** and interpreting results to make data-driven decisions.

## Tools and Technologies Used:

- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library used for building and evaluating the Decision Tree model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Used for visualizing the decision tree and performance metrics.

## Future Aspirations
Iâ€™m looking forward to applying these skills to future projects and continuing my growth in **data science** and **machine learning**. ðŸš€
